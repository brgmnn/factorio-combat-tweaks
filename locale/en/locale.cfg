# Enemies
combat-tweaks--use-enemies=Replace the vanilla biters with new faction based biters
combat-tweaks--new-enemy-map-colors=Change enemy map colors to match their faction
# Research
combat-tweaks--enable-artillery-range-linear-scaling=Changes how the artillery range infinite research science cost scales. Instead of doubling with each research it will increase by 500 science with each research. Useful if you want to easily research higher levels of artillery range.
# Weapon modifiers
combat-tweaks--laser-turret-damage-modifier=Adjust damage of laser turrets.
combat-tweaks--cannon-shell-range=Range of fire for both cannon shell ammo as well as weapons that accept cannon shells.
combat-tweaks--min-cannon-turret-range=Minimum cannon turret range. Used for mods that add cannon turrets.
# Train modifiers
combat-tweaks--deadly-trains=Try and guarantee trains roll through biters by decreasing energy consuption per hitpoint trains spend to kill units. This will make trains extremely deadly, even very slow moving trains will insta-kill a player.
# Unkillable descriptions
combat-tweaks--safe-buildings--rails=Includes both straight and curved rails
combat-tweaks--safe-buildings--rail-signals=Includes both normal and chain signals
combat-tweaks--unkillable-construction-robot=This will make construction robots immune to all damage. Useful if your robots are frequently killed whilst flying outside of walls. This will also make placing landmines viable as construction bots can place them without any danger.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-logistic-robot=This will make logistic robots immune to all damage. Useful if your robots are frequently killed whilst flying outside of walls.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-artillery-wagon=This will make artillery wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-cargo-wagon=This will make cargo wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-fluid-wagon=This will make fluid wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-land-mine=This will make land mines immune to all damage. Note that despite this land mines still detonate on enemy proximity and do damage, they just cant take damage (eg. from spitters).
combat-tweaks--unkillable-locomotive=This will make locomotives immune to all damage.
