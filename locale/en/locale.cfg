[mod-setting-description]
combat-tweaks--cannon-shell-range=Range of fire for both cannon shell ammo as well as weapons that accept cannon shells.
combat-tweaks--min-cannon-turret-range=Minimum cannon turret range. Used for mods that add cannon turrets.

combat-tweaks--deadly-trains=Try and guarantee trains roll through biters by decreasing energy consuption per hitpoint trains spend to kill units. This will make trains extremely deadly, even very slow moving trains will insta-kill a player.

combat-tweaks--unkillable-artillery-wagon=This will make artillery wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-cargo-wagon=This will make cargo wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-fluid-wagon=This will make fluid wagons immune to all damage.
combat-tweaks--unkillable-land-mine=This will make land mines immune to all damage. Note that despite this land mines still detonate on enemy proximity and do damage, they just can't take damage (eg. from spitters).
combat-tweaks--unkillable-locomotive=This will make locomotives immune to all damage.
